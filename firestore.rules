/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for ChronoZen application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. Each user can only access their own profile data and timer usage statistics.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - All data is nested under /users/{userId}.
 * - User profiles are stored in /users/{userId}/profile.
 * - Timer usage statistics are stored in /users/{userId}/timerUsages/{timerUsageId}.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - All writes require a verified user identity.
 * - Rules are designed for Authorization Independence, avoiding costly get() calls.
 * - Data consistency between the path and document's internal fields is enforced on create and update.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The `userId` is included in both `/users/{userId}/profile` and `/users/{userId}/timerUsages/{timerUsageId}` documents to ensure proper ownership.
